Building
========

Backend
-------

None of the Python backend is compiled. So there is no build step.

Frontend
--------

From the **ui** directory inside the repository, there are several **npm run** scripts/commands that you can use in
each stage of development.

If you are working on live changes and want to see the results immediately, you can run::

    $ npm start
