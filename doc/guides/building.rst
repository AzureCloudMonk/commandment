Building Commandment
====================

Install Python 3
----------------

Commandment requires python >= 3.5 for its type annotation support.
On the mac you can install python 3 via _`Homebrew <https://brew.sh>` like so::

    $ brew install python3

If you are running commandment on linux, python 3 will be available via your package manager of choice.
